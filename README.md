3D Object Detection Based on Voxel Transformer for Autonomous Driving.

Robust 3D object detector from point cloud plays a key role in autonomous driving. However, previous detectors ignored the detection accuracy of small-scale objects (e.g., Pedestrian and Cyclist) and focused on detecting the large-scale car categories. In this paper, we propose a multi-scale prediction region convolutional neural network (MSP-RCNN) for 3D object detection based on autonomous driving. It focuses on solving the feature representation for small-scale object and higher precision detection based on poor condition by using 3D Voxel Transformer Convolution module, Propose-centrical key-point sampling, and multi-scale region proposal detection network. MSP-RCNN sets up the multi-module feature fusion through combing global 3D Voxel Convolutional with local key point features to achieve self-attention 3D object representation. In addition, the multi-scale region proposal detection head increases the small-scale object detection precision with the bounding box regression at different levels. The evaluation on the KITTI detection dataset proves the improvement of the proposed MSP-RCNN, which only uses the point cloud data. 
Meanwhile, experiment on the NuScenes dataset shows the robust representation capacity to the condition of severe climate with illumination variation.
